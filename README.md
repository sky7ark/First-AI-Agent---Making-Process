# First AI Agent Making Process
🤖 First AI Agent: From Prompt to Action (Kaggle Course)

This project is part of Kaggle’s 5-day *AI Agents* course.  
It demonstrates how to create a simple AI agent using Google’s **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and **Gemini API**.

🧩 Key Learnings
- Installed and configured the **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**.
- Integrated **Gemini API keys** for secure model access.
- Built and ran a simple AI agent capable of using external tools (like Google Search).
- Learned how to handle model actions, tool calling, and structured responses.

🚀 Outcome
Created an interactive AI agent that can autonomously search for information and respond intelligently — the foundation for building more advanced autonomous AI systems.
